# IBIS

IBIS is a flexible edge computing infrastructure framework designed to simplify the deployment and management of measurement applications on distributed edge devices. Built as a customization of [CHI@Edge](https://chameleoncloud.org/experiment/chiedge/), IBIS trades granular control for ease of use, making it accessible for researchers and organizations to deploy wide-scale data collection campaigns without extensive technical expertise.

## Overview

The IBIS framework provides a complete infrastructure stack for:
- **Remote application deployment**: Deploy custom measurement and monitoring applications to edge devices on scheduled intervals
- **Centralized device management**: Monitor and manage fleets of edge devices from a unified dashboard
- **Data collection pipeline**: Automated data upload from edge devices to highly available datacenter services
- **Flexible hardware integration**: Support for various peripherals (GPS, cameras, environmental sensors, etc.) to adapt to diverse research objectives
- **Multi-tenant support**: Run multiple independent applications on the same infrastructure

Originally developed to support broadband quality studies through the [FLOTO Center for Broadband Research](floto.cs.uchicago.edu), IBIS's architecture enables researchers to easily adapt the infrastructure for new scientific domains by integrating custom peripherals and measurement applicationsâ€”from environmental monitoring to agricultural sensing.

# What is Ibis-in-a-box?

Ibis-in-a-box is packaging of the core services that compose the Ibis Infrastructure. This includes

1. The Ibis Dashboard + API
1. An authentication service, Keycloak
1. Underlying device management service, [openBalena](https://open-balena-docs.balena.io/)
1. Underlying application management service, [k3s](https://k3s.io/)

This project is currently a work in progress, and supports only a development deployment of parts #1 and #2.

# Usage

In order to set up your own Ibis site, follow the below steps. We assume these steps take place on a fresh Ubuntu 22 VM.

1. Clone this repository
1. Edit `values.yaml` as needed fit
1. Run `./ibis install` - To install ansible dependencies, and docker runtime on host.
1. Run `./ibis keycloak` - To install the authentication service.
1. Run `./ibis dashboard` - To install the dashboard service.

Once complete, you can expose services via `sshuttle`. For example
```
sshuttle --auto-hosts --remote cc@$IP $(ssh cc@$IP ip -f inet addr show ens3 | awk '/inet / {print $2}')
```

Then in your browser, you can connect to services:

1. Keycloak - http://ibis.local

1. Dashboard - http://ibis.local:8080/
    - After initial log in, run `./ibis admin` to make a user an admin in the dashboard.
